# GET RICH / DIVE TRYING

You are the diver.

Press any button to dive deeper, release to float upward. 
Left and right movement is controlled by the underwater currents. 
Click (or touch!) to select a reward from the treasure chest.

Navigate shark (and eel, and turtle, and octopus...) infested waters to reach the treasure chests.

Each chest you open offers an invaluable power-up for your journey, including but not limited to: Enhanced Flippers, Oxygen Tank, Shark Repellant, and most importantly, New Friends. Choose wisely.

Will you get rich, or dive trying?

#### Developer Notes:

This being our first finished game AND first game jam ever, we wanted to go all in and not play it too safe. The challenge with this game was keeping it fun while maintaining a commitment to the minimal, single-input gameplay. Options for power ups, abilities, movement, etc. were limited and required a very creative thought process for introducing new functionality to make the game more fun for players. For us, this made developing Get Rich / Dive Trying such a fun game to develop, especially within the time crunch of a game jam. Early in development, while we enjoyed the game, we never thought we'd go this far with it. We're happy to say we're thrilled with the outcome! Because of this, we've decided to continue development after the game jam concludes. Further on, we lay out some of our longer term goals for Get Rich / Dive Trying.

The difficulting scaling/balancing was tailor made for a short play time for the Pixel Game Jam. Future iterations would include difficulty scaling tailored for longer playtimes.

Goals for future iterations:
- Better difficulty scaling/balancing
- Shop System with permanantly equipable items and buffs (and debuffs, maybe?)
- Payout System with money spawns throughout levels (for spending in the shop!)
- More chest items, buffs, and powerups. 
- More types of streams, e.g. streams with replenish oxygen, streams which grant invincibility while you're in them 
- Polished UI
